Breast Cancer Diagnostic Prediction Project
Overview
This project utilizes the Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset to develop and implement predictive machine learning models aimed at diagnosing breast cancer in patients.

Dataset Description
The Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset includes data from patients with various biomarkers, comprising 10 features such as:

Glucose
HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment)
[Add any additional variables here]
These features are essential for training the machine learning models to accurately predict breast cancer diagnoses.

Objectives
Build predictive models to assess the likelihood of breast cancer diagnosis based on biomarker data.
Analyze the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
Usage
[Include instructions on how to run the project, any dependencies, and how to interpret the results.]
