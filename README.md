# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview

This project utilizes the Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset to develop and implement predictive machine learning models aimed at diagnosing breast cancer in patients. 

## Dataset Description

The Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset includes data from real patients with various biomarkers, comprising 10 features such as:

- Age
- BMI
- Glucose
- HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment)
- Insulin

## Objectives

- Clean and pre-process the dataset (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Build predictive models to assess the likelihood of breast cancer diagnosis based on biomarker data.
- Perform Hyperparameter tuning of different ML models to achieve higher accuracy. 
- Evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms.

## Instruction

1. Run the environment.yaml to install the required packages for this project
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
